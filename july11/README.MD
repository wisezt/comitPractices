There are total 3 classes.

The first is the "Song.java" which is used to store song's "Title" and "Author".

The second and most important is the "MusicPlayer.java" including all the functions
as display menu, show playlist, add song, play song and quit.

The last one is "MusicPlayerProgram.java" which is used to initial and invoke the "Music Player".

If you find any bugs, please let me know.
Thank you
