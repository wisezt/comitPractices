## Architecture
You can design this program however you'd want to. In fact I recommend you do some thinking of how to
structure this program before reading on! Here are some of my suggestions: 

1. Create a "Song.java" class
- This object will have 2 attributes: "title" and "author".
- For the methods we will write getters and setters for "title" and "author".
- We will add a "toString()" method to display information about the Song.
- We will add a "play()" method to show that the song is currently playing.

2. Create a "MusicPlayer.java" class
- This object will manage a list of Song objects.
- Create an "add(String title, String author)" method that will create a new Song object
with the parameters "title" and "author"; and add this newly created Song to our list of Song objects.
- Create a "play(int songIndex)" method that will play the Song object in our list[songIndex].
- Create a "showPlaylist()" method that will display the current Song objects in list.

3. Create a "MusicPlayerProgram.java" class
- This object will contain an instance/object of "MusicPlayer".
- This object will contain a `static void main(String[] args)` method that will display the menu, 
get the command from the user and perform the corresponding tasks.
- Create a "displayMenu()" method to display the menu.
- Create a "getCommand()" method that will get the corresponding command from the user and perform
corresponding action on the MusicPlayer object.
